# elma_project
The final project for embedded class
My goal of the final project is to convert the Elma to with Java.
The success for me will be that the converted Java Elma can do all the things that the current C++ Elma can.
In order to achieve that I will need the Elma base code, Java libraries, online sources.

Here are my current five milestones:
1. Talk with the Professor about the feasibility of the project idea.
2. Create the Java environment.
3. Start with the manager, process and channel classes.
4. Create the statemachine class.
5. Achieve the http data communication.
